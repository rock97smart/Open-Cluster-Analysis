# Open-Cluster-Analysis
Analyzed the stellar properties of selected open clusters Berkeley 59 and King 12 and to determine their mass function through photometric classification, zero point calibration and then analyze them further by plotting the HR diagrams and fitting theoretical isochrones obtained from the MIST and PARSEC datasets to estimate the age of the cluster.
All the observational data for the analysis were obtained using the Growth India Telescope (Hanle, Ladakh, India) with help from STAR Lab, IIT Bombay.

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and photometric filtering
- Color–magnitude diagram construction
- Comparison with stellar evolution models
- Error propagation and basic statistical analysis

## Tools
Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Astropy

## Data Availability
The original observational data used in this project are not publicly available due to collaboration and telescope usage policies. This repository focuses on the analysis pipeline and methodology.
