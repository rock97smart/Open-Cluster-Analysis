# Open-Cluster-Analysis
Analyzed the stellar properties of selected open clusters Berkeley 59 and King 12 and to determine their mass function through photometric classification, zero point calibration and then analyze them further by plotting the HR diagrams and fitting theoretical isochrones obtained from the MIST and PARSEC datasets to estimate the age of the cluster.
